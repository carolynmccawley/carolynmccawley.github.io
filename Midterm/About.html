		<h2>About</h2>

		<p>
			Welcome to Lire le Livre! Our policy is to read, read, and read! We encourage our readers to read a book a week. We recommend five books a week, but if none of the books there encourage you, we have a daily recommendation so everyone can find something they like. We want everyone to find the perfect book so we are constantly updating our website because there is always a book to be read and loved! Follow us on social media and give us your recommendations!
		</p>
		<p>
			Lire Le Livre was founded in 2018 by Carolyn McCawley. She was inspired to create the website after reading Robinson Crusoe. She had never hated a book more and she wanted the world to have easy access to find a book they can enjoy. She searches through bookstores and the internet for her recommendations so you donâ€™t have to. She knows that everyone has busy and hectic lives and finding a book should be easy rather than a chore. Keep on reading!
