				<h3>A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking</h3>
				<p>
					In honor of his recent passing, we recommend readers to read the famous scientist’s world renown book. 
				</p>
				<p>
					A landmark volume in science writing by one of the great minds of our time, Stephen Hawking’s book explores such profound questions as: How did the universe begin—and what made its start possible? Does time always flow forward? Is the universe unending—or are there boundaries? Are there other dimensions in space? What will happen when it all ends?
				</p>
				<p>
					Told in language we all can understand, A Brief History of Time plunges into the exotic realms of black holes and quarks, of antimatter and “arrows of time,” of the big bang and a bigger God—where the possibilities are wondrous and unexpected. With exciting images and profound imagination, Stephen Hawking brings us closer to the ultimate secrets at the very heart of creation.

				<h3>About the Author</h3>
				<p>
					Stephen King was an English theoretical physicist, cosmologist, author, and Director of Research at the Centre for Theoretical Cosmology within the University of Cambridge. He is famous for having the first theory of cosmology that is explained by a union of the general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics. Stephen King studied at University of Oxford and University of Cambridge where he received his master’s and PhD. Up until the day he died, Hawking was a fierce supporter of knowledge and learning; he was constantly building and improving his own theories and ideas during his years of research.

				<h3>Reviews</h3>
				<p>
					Absolutely blew my mind!
				</p>

				<p>
					Frankly I'm unqualified to rate this. Thus, it gets a 5 star to avoid doing it a disservice. While considering myself fairly intelligent, it's evident I'm not in this league. Having read and understood all of the words in this book, I just do not have a firm grasp on much of what Mr. Hawking presents. The concepts, proofs and theories are beyond my ability to comprehend. He makes a great attempt to reach the non-scientist reader. A really good job; a terrific effort. But this reader wasn't up to the task.
				</p>
				<p>
					This book should be required reading for any person who plans to study physics. It is equally enlightening as it is at times humorous. Within the first two chapters of reading, I had a better understanding of the Theory of Relativity than I had gathered up to that point in my life. I will admit that his dissertations on Quantum Mechanics left me a little dizzy at times, but all in all, this is one of the most enlightening books i have ever read. It reads very quickly, and surprisingly, with considerable humor. I recommend it to all who have any desire to understand the formation of the universe and it's probable course.
