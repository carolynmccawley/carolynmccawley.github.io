                <p id="appDesc">PriCoSha is a Flask app developed by Andrew Lucero , Carolyn Ann McCawley, and Cindy Lee.
                    Our project has a public home page that will show content to users who are not logged in yet,
                    offering the option to register and to log in. After a user logs in, the user is redirected to the home
                    page. On the home page, both guests and users are able to view public posts within the last 24 hours.
                    Users, however, can view all the posts that they created.
                    Users who are logged in have the ability to view posts that are shared with them, as well as the ability
                    to share posts, or tag other users in posts that public for them. When users are tagged in posts, they have
                    the ability to either decline or accept the tag (or just leave it as pending) on the pending tags page.
                    When a user tags another user in a post that is not public to the other user, an error is
                    displayed on the index page.
                    Users have the ability to post content. Text is mandatory, but there is the option to upload
                    an image, as well as the option to mark posts to be public or private before posting. If a user
                    has marked a post as private, after posting, there is the option to share the post with groups
                    that user belongs to. Speaking of groups, users have the option to create groups of users to
                    share content to. Users can add users to groups that they own.

                <p>Additional Features:</p>
                
                <ul><li>The ability to upload images in addition to text, and the ability to filter posts by content type (such as images or text)
                </li></ul>
                
                <ul><li>The ability to rate posts. Users are able to change their ratings; the number corresponding with which rating given is displayed on the individual post</li></ul>
                
                <ul><li>Removing groups, removing a user from a group, and the ability to sever users. Severing a user removes them from all of your groups and removes you from all their groups</li></ul>
                
                <ul><li>Commenting: a user is able to click on a post and redirected to a new page where all the comments are dispalyed and they are able to add their own</li></ul>
